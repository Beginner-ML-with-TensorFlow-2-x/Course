# Machine Learning Fundamentals

  * Artificial Intelligence (Russell, Norvig 2016)
    * Definition: overall introduction using the fourth quadrants, and then general categories problem solving, knowledge, reasoning and planning and learning and perciving and acting i.e. robotics
    * Foundation
    * History
  * Machine Learning
    * Solving problem without algorithms
      * Supervised vs unsupervised
      * Parametric vs nonparametrics (i.e automl) learning
    * Fundamental topics
      * Neural Networks
      * Gradient Descent
      * Backpropagation
      * Feature Engineering
      * Overfitting and underfitting: from memorization to generalization
      * Activation Function
    * Machine Learning Workflow
    * Popular examples
      * Sequential 
      * LSTM
    * Federated Learning
  * Tensorflow 2.0
    * What is Tensorflow?
      * Easy model building
      * Robust ML production anywhere
      * Powerful for research
