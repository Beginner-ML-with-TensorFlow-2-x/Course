#Â Introduction
  * Definition of Machine Learning
  
      * Machine learning arises from this question: could a computer go beyond "what we know how to order it to perform" and learn on its own how to perform a specified task? 
      * Could a computer surprise us? Rather than programmers crafting data-processing rules by hand, could a computer automatically learn these rules by looking at data?

  * Artificial Intelligence vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning

    * Use diagram from Chapter 1 (Deep Learning with Python) to Artificial Intelligence includes Machine Learning includes Deep Learning or
    * timelined chart: https://learnwebskill.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ai-timeline-what-is-deep-learning.png

  * Machine Learning Workflow steps to provide structured approach to creating solutions.

    * As per https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/problem-framing: Define ML problem and propose solution -> Construct your dataset -> Transform Data -> Train a model -> Use the model to make predictions
