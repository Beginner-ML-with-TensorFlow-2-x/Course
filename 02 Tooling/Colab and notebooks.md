[TODO] Intro Jupyter notebooks

There are several options to run notebooks in Google:

### Colaboratory
Based on Jupyter, it is a Google Brain product, not part of Google Cloud. Mainly targeted for research, it's a research product to help and disseminate ML education. 
Provides a free-of-charge environment, **including free GPU and TPU**, and is integrated with Google Driv (you can "mount" Drive on Colaboratory).

### Colaboratory Pro
is a Google Brain product, not part of Google Cloud. [Announced in February 2020](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/pro.ipynb), it's a paid-based product (USD 9.99 / month), which provides faster GPUs(T4, P100), high-memory VMs and longer runtimes (before runtimes were resetted every 12 hours)

### CAIP notebooks
Google Cloud AI Platforms notebooks, a managed service for JupyterLab, enterprise-grade, built on top of DL VM images. It is executed in user projects, and is now part of AI Platform.
